# Bakery-monthly-sales-target

In this project, I  delve into the April data of a bakery, focusing on outlets with IDs 3, 5, and 8. The aim is to assess which outlets achieved their monthly sales targets and identify the factors contributing to success or failure. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance marketing effectiveness.

### Objectives:
- Analyze April data of bakery outlets (ID 3, 5, and 8).
- Determine which outlets met their monthly sales targets.
- Identify success factors and reasons for failure.
- Propose marketing strategies for improving performance.

### Key Findings:
- Outlets 3 and 8 successfully achieved their monthly sales goals, while Outlet 5 fell short.
- Success of Outlets 3 and 8 is attributed mainly to strong performance in the beverage product group.
- Outlets 3 and 8 struggled to meet targets in other product groups.
- Despite meeting targets in the beverage category, Outlet 5's overall performance was insufficient.
- Repeat customer rate is high, indicating customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- New customer acquisition rate is low, highlighting the need for expanding the customer base.

### Recommendations:
- Target marketing efforts towards the young millennial and Gen Z demographic, who are prominent consumers.
- Develop strategies to attract new customers, focusing on younger demographics.
- Enhance product offerings and marketing campaigns to appeal to a wider audience.
- Consider diversifying product lines or promotions to boost sales across all product groups.
- Continuously monitor customer dynamics and adapt marketing strategies accordingly.

This analysis provides insights into the performance of bakery outlets and offers actionable recommendations to drive future success.
